Q17

A company with global offices has a single 1 Gbps AWS Direct Connect connection to a single AWS Region. The company’s on-premises network uses the connection to communicate with the company’s resources in the AWS Cloud. The connection has a single private virtual interface that connects to a single VPC.
A solutions architect must implement a solution that adds a redundant Direct Connect connection in the same Region. The solution also must provide connectivity to other Regions through the same pair of Direct Connect connections as the company expands into other Regions.
Which solution meets these requirements?

A. Provision a Direct Connect gateway. Delete the existing private virtual interface from the existing connection. Create the second Direct Connect connection. Create a new private virtual interface on each connection, and connect both private virtual interfaces to the Direct Connect gateway. Connect the Direct Connect gateway to the single VPC.
B. Keep the existing private virtual interface. Create the second Direct Connect connection. Create a new private virtual interface on the new connection, and connect the new private virtual interface to the single VPC.
C. Keep the existing private virtual interface. Create the second Direct Connect connection. Create a new public virtual interface on the new connection, and connect the new public virtual interface to the single VPC.
D. Provision a transit gateway. Delete the existing private virtual interface from the existing connection. Create the second Direct Connect connection. Create a new private virtual interface on each connection, and connect both private virtual interfaces to the transit gateway. Associate the transit gateway with the single VPC.

## 생각들

transit gateway, direct connect gateway 이런것들을 
이론은 대충 공부를 했는데  실제로 써보진 않아서.. 헷갈린다.

the company expands into other Regions. 라는 말이 있어 transit gateway 가 vpc 들의 확장성을 위한 것이니 D를 선택햇는데, 답은 A라고 한다.

Direct Connect gateway에 대해서 더 알아보자.

## 풀이 및 공부 

Direct Connect Gateway :  다수의 VPC가 물리적인 인터페이스를 하나만 두고서도 연결이 가능하도록 하는 서비스(타 리전의 vpc도 , 온프레미스에 연결된 dx와 통신 가능)
